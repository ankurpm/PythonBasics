🧩 Beginner Level (Basics & Accessing Elements)
1️⃣ Create a Tuple

👉 Task:
Create a tuple called fruits that contains three fruit names.
Print the tuple and its type.

2️⃣ Access Tuple Elements

👉 Task:
Given:

colors = ("red", "green", "blue", "yellow")


Print:

The first color

The last color

The second-to-last color using negative indexing

3️⃣ Tuple Length

👉 Task:
Find and print how many elements are in this tuple:

animals = ("cat", "dog", "rabbit", "parrot", "dog")

4️⃣ Index of an Element

👉 Task:
Using .index(), find the index of "dog" in the tuple above.

5️⃣ Count Occurrences

👉 Task:
Using .count(), find how many times "dog" appears in the same tuple.

⚙️ Intermediate Level (Unpacking & Nesting)
6️⃣ Tuple Unpacking

👉 Task:
Given:

person = ("Ankur", 34, "Software Engineer")


Unpack it into three variables: name, age, and job,
then print them in a formatted sentence like:

“Ankur is 34 years old and works as a Software Engineer.”

7️⃣ Nested Tuples

👉 Task:
Create a tuple that represents 3 points in 2D space:

points = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))


Print each point in the format:

“Point 1: x=1, y=2”

(Hint: Use a for loop with unpacking.)

8️⃣ Tuple Concatenation

👉 Task:
Concatenate these two tuples and print the result:

t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = (4, 5, 6)

🧠 Advanced Level (Immutability & Conversion)
9️⃣ Tuple Immutability Test

👉 Task:
Try to change the second element of this tuple:

t = (10, 20, 30)


Observe and note what error you get.

Then, explain why.

🔟 Tuple ↔ List Conversion

👉 Task:
Convert this tuple into a list, add one more element ("mango"),
and then convert it back into a tuple.

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

🧩 💡 Bonus Challenge

Given:

students = (
    ("Ankur", 85),
    ("Priya", 90),
    ("Ravi", 78),
)


Write a loop to print:

Ankur scored 85
Priya scored 90
Ravi scored 78
